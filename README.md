PG-Life is a dynamic web application developed during my internship training with Internshala. This platform is designed to help students seamlessly find paying guest (PG) accommodations when moving to new cities for education or work. With an intuitive interface, PG-Life enables users to browse a wide range of accommodations, filter options based on their preferences, and make informed decisions. The project focuses on simplifying the relocation process for students by offering a reliable and user-friendly solution tailored to their unique needs.
